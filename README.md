## Goal
This project aims to create a comprehensive tool to extract headlines from RSS feeds from a list of international outlets related to particular agents and generate three-dimensional semantic differential plots quantifying perceived Evaluation (good-bad), Potency (strong-weak) and Activity (active-passive) of the agent across multiple media outlets.
The tool is designed to support media analysis and related tasks with a current focus on Spanish-language materials by researchers, students or other interested parties.
