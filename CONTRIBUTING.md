# Contributing to Gracian
> Alone a youth runs fast, with an elder slow, but together they go far. â€”[Luo proverb](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/12/25/if-you-want-to-go-fast/)
## Current goals:
0) CoC
1) Implement scrapers for missing outlets.
2) Optimize performance.
3) Expand documentation and resources.
4) Translation of documentation. This tool is currently focused on analysing texts in Spanish, so it is expected to be especially useful for Spanish-speaking researchers and students. Having clear documentation and resources in Spanish is a priority of the project.
## Style Guide
### Identifier naming conventions
| Element     | Casing      | Language      | Flexibility      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Variables, functions, methods | camelCase | English | No      |
| Classes and similar constructs | PascalCase | English | No      |
| Files and Modules | camelCase (if the programming language and tools allow for it, e.g., Java's class-name matching issues) | English | Yes      |
### Code formatting
1) Use tabs for indentation to keep consistency and readability.
2) Avoid trailing whitespace and extra whitespace when using parentheses.
3) Use only UTF-8 encoding for source and data files.
4) Emoticons are accepted as long as they use basic characters only. Emojis can be used in markdown documents, communication with other contributors or other materials outside of source code or configuration files. The use of both emojis and emoticons must remain respectful towards other contributors and general public.
### Contribution Policy
#### Mutual respect
Gracian is an open and respectful environment. Any conduct against those values has to be reported to [pancardodev@proton.me](pancardodev@proton.me) as soon as possible.
#### Benevolence
All code provided has to be non-malicious. Any contribution presumed to be malicious will be rejected, and more than five suspected contributions with less than three months between them will cause a suspension based on the perceived risk.
#### Minimal dependencies
Overreliance on external dependencies can be harmful to the maintainability and usage of the tools, so any new dependency that is not needed has to be explained and approved beforehand.
#### LLM usage
Large Language Models are very useful in code assistance, data annotation or documentation, but all contributions with the participation of an LLM have to be marked as such in the commit comment with the notes ```[LLM written]``` or ```[LLM checked]``` and comply to the following guidelines:
1) Human review. All code or text has to be checked for errors, false information, non-respectful content and goal alignment. Repeated low quality contributions will cause temporary suspension.
2) Compliance with this Style Guide and all other community rules, guidelines or limitations.
3) LLM-assisted code, as any other submission, has to meet all applicable legal requirements, incluiding copyright and licencing affairs.
Valid LLM-marked commits will be treated on equal terms as any other contribution and will not be considered less valuable contributions.
