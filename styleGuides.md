## Code formatting
1) Use tabs for indentation to keep consistency and readibility.
2) Avoid trailing whitespace and extra whitespace when using parentheses.
3) Use basic English characters whitin your code and comments, emoticons are accepted as long as they use basic character only. Emojis can be used in markdown documents, communication with other contributors or other materials outside of source code or configuration files. The use of both emojis and emoticons has to be respectful of other contributors and general public.
## Contribution Policy
### Mutual respect
Gracian is an open and respectful environment. Any conduct against those values has to be reported as soon as possible.
### Benevolence
All code provided has to be non-malicious. Any contribution pressumed to be malicious will be rejected, and more than five suspected contributions with less than three months between them will cause a suspension based on the perceived risk.
### Minimal dependencies
Overreliance on external dependencies can be harmful to the maintanibility and usage of the tools, so any new dependence that is not needed has to be explained and approved beforehand.
### LLM usage
Large Language Models are very useful in code assistance, data annotation or documentation, but all contributions with the participation of an LLM have to be marked as such in the commit comment and comply to the following guidelines:
1) Human review: All code or text has to be checked for errors, false information, non-respectful content and goal-accomplishment. Repeated low quality contributions will cause temporary suspension.
2) Compliance with this Style Guide.
